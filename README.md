# QT Remote Control Client V2

This is a QT Gui / Application that was made in QT Creator to be used as a bridge between a computer and a robot. This is the second iterration of this software and has greatly improved in look, functionality, and performance over the previous iterration. This is the "brains" of the remote control for a remote control mechanum car. The server-side counter-part to this application can be found [here](https://github.com/baxtrax/QT-Remote-Control-Server). Although at the momment this program does not have networking funcionality as it is still a work in progress. Still use the previous iterration until this one is complete.
